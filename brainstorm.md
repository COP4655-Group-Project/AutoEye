Top 3 App Ideas
-
1. Taillight App
    - Unique idea
    - Implement Vision API with knowledge on how to implement APIs
    - Would use features learned in course such as back end database for accounts, uploading picture features, accessing camera
    - Would need to figure out safety implementations (pop-up for drivers to agree to not use while driving, etc.)
2. Song of the Day
    - Similar to BeReal Project
    - Would use feature implementations from course
    - How would users upload music? If from music API, there's only certain songs they can choose
    - Photos can be uploaded from Photos App but where would songs be accessed from
3. Calorie Counter App
    - Basic app idea, lots of apps like it
    - Would implement features from earlier projects such as labels and user input
